# machine-learning

Welcome!

My name is Miguel Benavides, an aspiring machine learning practitioner. Here you'll find a number of machine learning algorithms that I've tried implementing from scratch. I try as much as possible to recreate them from the theory and use no other libraries except python's own and of course the scipy stack. 

I'm new to GitHub, so I would love to get feedback on how I can best use this website. If you have the time and interest to propose a tweak or a new project, you can reach me through facebook, twitter, or gmail.
